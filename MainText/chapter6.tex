\chapter{Expected outcomes} \label{ch-1}
There are 3 key outcomes we wish to achieve:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Devising new algorithms for elementary operations with various classes of skew polynomials
    \item Develop new algorithms for computations related to Drinfeld modules, and in particular computing the minimal polynomial.
    \item Create implementations for existing and new algorithms that achieve optimal theoretical bounds where this is feasible.
\end{enumerate}
